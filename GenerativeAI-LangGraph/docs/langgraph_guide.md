# LangGraph Guide

This document provides a guide on how to use the LangGraph module in the GenerativeAI-LangGraph project.

## Overview

LangGraph is a module that uses Generative AI concepts to create a language graph. This graph can be used to generate new sentences based on the structure and semantics of the input data.

## Getting Started

To use the LangGraph module, you first need to import it in your Python script:

```python
from src.langgraph import models, utils
```

## Creating a Graph

To create a graph, you need to instantiate the `Graph` class from the `models` module:

```python
graph = models.Graph()
```

## Adding Nodes and Edges

You can add nodes and edges to the graph using the `add_node` and `add_edge` methods:

```python
node1 = models.Node('Node 1')
node2 = models.Node('Node 2')
edge = models.Edge(node1, node2)

graph.add_node(node1)
graph.add_node(node2)
graph.add_edge(edge)
```

## Generating Sentences

Once you have a graph, you can generate sentences using the `generate_sentence` function from the `utils` module:

```python
sentence = utils.generate_sentence(graph)
print(sentence)
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a basic introduction to the LangGraph module. For more detailed information, please refer to the API documentation and the source code.
