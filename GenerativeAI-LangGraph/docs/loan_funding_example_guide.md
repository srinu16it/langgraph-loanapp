# Loan Funding Example Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the loan funding example in the GenerativeAI-LangGraph project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Step 1: Import the necessary modules

First, import the necessary modules from the `langgraph` and `agents` packages.

```python
from langgraph import models, utils
from agents import loan_funding_agent
```

## Step 2: Initialize the LangGraph

Next, initialize the LangGraph with the necessary parameters.

```python
graph = models.LangGraph(parameters)
```

## Step 3: Initialize the LoanFundingAgent

After that, initialize the LoanFundingAgent with the necessary parameters.

```python
agent = loan_funding_agent.LoanFundingAgent(parameters)
```

## Step 4: Run the agent

Finally, run the agent to simulate the process of funding a loan.

```python
agent.run(graph)
```

## Conclusion

This guide walked you through the process of running the loan funding example in the GenerativeAI-LangGraph project. For more information about the `langgraph` and `agents` modules, refer to the respective guides.
